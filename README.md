### OpenAI Swarm:
According to OpenAI, swarm focuses on “making agent coordination and execution lightweight, highly controllable, and easily testable.” Swarm uses two sub-systems of ‘agents’ or ‘routines’ and ‘hand-offs’, where an agent is responsible for instructions and tools and at any point during the process, can hand off the responsibility to another agent.


## Google's RIG system in DataGemma
Google introduced its latest model, DataGemma, which unlike previous RAG systems works on a RIG (Retrieval Interleaved Generation) technique, which merges Language Models with Data Commons, which is an open-source large-scale database of public data.

## Adala Autonomous Data Labelling System
Adala offers a robust framework for implementing agents specialized in data processing, with an emphasis on diverse data labelling tasks. These agents are autonomous, meaning they can independently acquire one or more skills through iterative learning. This learning process is influenced by their operating environment, observations, and reflections. Users define the environment by providing a ground truth dataset. Every agent learns and applies its skills in what we refer to as a "runtime", synonymous with LLM.
