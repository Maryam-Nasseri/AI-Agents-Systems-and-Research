## A Collection of the Latest AI Agents Systems and Research Initiatives & Video Tutorials
The links and explanations of these AI agentic systems and research: OpenAI Swarm, Google's RIG system in DataGemma, Adala automatic labelling system

### OpenAI Swarm:
According to OpenAI, swarm focuses on “making agent coordination and execution lightweight, highly controllable, and easily testable.” Swarm uses two sub-systems of ‘agents’ or ‘routines’ and ‘hand-offs’, where an agent is responsible for instructions and tools and at any point during the process, can hand off the responsibility to another agent.


## Google's RIG system in DataGemma
Google introduced its latest model, DataGemma, which unlike previous RAG systems works on a RIG (Retrieval Interleaved Generation) technique, which merges Language Models with Data Commons, which is an open-source large-scale database of public data.
